This is Gwenhywfar, a multi-platform helper library for networking and
security applications and libraries. 
It is used by 
 - Libchipcard (http://www.libchipcard.de), 
 - OpenHBCI2 (http://www.openhbci.de), 
 - Simthetic, the simulation tool (http://simthetic.sourceforge.net)
 - AqBanking/AqHBCI (http://www.aqbanking.de/).
 - and others by using one of the projects above



Features
========

This library is written in C, and it follows the object-oriented
programming paradigm for most of its parts.  The header files can
directly be used from C++, too.

Gwenhywfar includes the following features:

- Basic Data types for binary buffers, ring buffers, linked lists, 
  error objects, string lists (src/base/), buffered IO operations (src/io/)

- Macros for typesafe list management

- OS abstraction functions for directory and Internet address handling
  and library loading (src/os/)

- Networking functions which allow to manage many connections to be used
  economically even in single threaded applications

- High-level functions for parsing files with a simplified "XML-like"
  format and accessing them like a hierarchical database (src/parser/)
  It is able to process valid XML files, too.

- High-level cryptographic functions on top of OpenSSL functionality
  (src/crypt/)

- Support for interprocess communication (HTTP on top of SSL or plain
  TCP/UDP sockets, with or without certificates for clients and/or servers)

- A tool to generate simple data containers from XML files. It automatically
  generates getters, setters, constructor, destructor, deep-copy function,
  usage counter handling, modification tracking, functions for reading from 
  and writing to GWEN_DBs (used by AqBanking to create the transaction class)
